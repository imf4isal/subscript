00:00.060 --> 00:01.740
So who is this cause for?

00:02.130 --> 00:10.140
I specifically built this course for back end engineer like myself who are really building back in applications

00:10.140 --> 00:17.850
that clients consume, but they don't really necessarily understand what is going on behind the scenes.

00:17.850 --> 00:26.190
When a segment arrives at their application, what the operating system is doing, what is the application

00:26.190 --> 00:30.570
is listening on, and why the segment goes to a certain process but not the other.

00:30.720 --> 00:38.040
It's effectively tries to unveil and remove the blinds from this, you know, foggy, understanding

00:38.040 --> 00:39.630
and trying to build a bridge.

00:39.630 --> 00:46.710
That gap, as I talked about previously and also remember that the fact that we're using the word back

00:46.710 --> 00:53.520
and kind of indicate that there is a frontend that consumes that back in and mostly the medium that

00:53.520 --> 00:56.320
connects the back end to the front end is networking.

00:56.340 --> 01:02.850
So really good idea to understand what is happening behind the scenes when you're building these basic

01:02.850 --> 01:03.540
fundamentals.

01:03.690 --> 01:09.540
This course is also very good for frontend engineer who are trying to build back in application or built

01:09.540 --> 01:10.740
back in application before.

01:10.740 --> 01:11.790
Because guess what?

01:12.480 --> 01:19.140
Frontend engineers are those who make the calls to the back end to an API to consume it.

01:19.140 --> 01:26.310
So it's really interesting to send a call and really follow the call all the way to the back end and

01:26.310 --> 01:27.870
make sure that it actually reaches.

01:28.050 --> 01:32.970
So if there is a slowdown in a certain request, it doesn't mean that a back in is slow.

01:33.060 --> 01:40.020
Could be the networking between this point, to this point has certain limitation and it's good to understand

01:40.020 --> 01:45.060
that there could be a configuration in your client side when it comes to the network and is way lower

01:45.060 --> 01:46.830
level down beneath you.

01:47.070 --> 01:53.550
You know it doesn't it's not something you as on the application necessarily without Node.js or Python

01:53.550 --> 02:02.130
as low level is so understanding that and once you really understand is what really matters here when

02:02.130 --> 02:03.570
you understand you know what to do.

02:03.600 --> 02:10.320
When you don't understand, it becomes really a black box and you're just left out with more confusion.

02:10.500 --> 02:16.150
Because also for network engineers who are interested to build back end or frontend applications and

02:16.800 --> 02:20.220
not rendering already understand these basic fundamentals.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.710
You know, some, some of them you don't understand everything.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.150
Nobody does, obviously.

02:24.360 --> 02:30.810
But that gap that we talked about between the application and the networking is really huge.

02:30.810 --> 02:37.230
And you'll be surprised that most of the networking that I met, we don't see the application.

02:37.260 --> 02:43.620
They treat everything above Layer seven as an application, although there are so many other layers

02:43.620 --> 02:49.380
above that, you know, it's not just, oh, why is the application doing sending a reset to the socket?

02:49.950 --> 02:55.320
Well, sometimes the even the back end engineer doesn't understand why is happening, not necessarily.

02:55.320 --> 02:55.530
Right.

02:55.680 --> 03:02.010
So there is a huge gap between the network engineer and the backend engineer and I try to bridge that

03:02.010 --> 03:03.600
gap as much as possible.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.000
Sometimes I fail, sometimes I succeed.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.510
But this is the goal of this course, at least to bridge this gap.

03:09.510 --> 03:14.610
So if you are networking Jews who want to build application and you want to even to refresh your memory

03:14.610 --> 03:18.090
on this kind of thing, I think this course, this course might be for you.
