00:00.060 --> 00:00.810
Welcome, guys.

00:00.810 --> 00:09.260
This is a brand new section on my networking course and I called it overview of Popular Networking Protocols.

00:09.270 --> 00:17.790
Now that you are in a place in the course that you already know that what an IP protocol is, what a

00:17.940 --> 00:27.360
TCP protocol is, what a UDP understand that anything, any protocol out there must be built on top

00:27.360 --> 00:35.580
of these three protocols unless it's very low level, then it's built on a layer on a lower layer protocol

00:35.580 --> 00:36.180
than that.

00:36.570 --> 00:43.770
But most of our protocol that you work with out there on a daily basis, HTTP built on top of TCP which

00:43.770 --> 00:55.740
is built on top of the IP CDB to build on top of TCP which is built on top of IP DNS built on top of

00:55.770 --> 00:58.230
UDP which is built on top of IP.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.180
What else?

01:02.440 --> 01:07.660
As such, built on top, directly on top of TCP, which is built on top of IP.

01:08.350 --> 01:12.310
And there are many, many other examples as I as I can think about it.

01:12.610 --> 01:18.400
Quick SDB three, SDB three is built on top of quick with a brand new protocol that is built on top

01:18.400 --> 01:20.470
of what UDP.

01:20.620 --> 01:21.580
Exactly.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.890
So UDP is built on top of IP.

01:25.390 --> 01:27.760
So many other examples that comes to my mind.

01:27.760 --> 01:36.160
If I if I can remember a lot of TLS, TLS is built on top of TCP, although it is kind of a protocol

01:36.160 --> 01:36.880
independent.

01:36.910 --> 01:39.100
It is by default built on top of TCP.

01:39.130 --> 01:47.780
So that includes HTTPS, which is best built on top of TLS that uses TCP.

01:48.370 --> 01:55.330
So TLS is basically the encryption protocol that allows to encrypt to communication.

01:55.330 --> 02:05.920
So what I'm going to do in this section is give a brief overview of each of these protocols and why

02:06.100 --> 02:07.150
why brief now?

02:07.600 --> 02:16.060
Because each of these protocols that I talked about deserve to be honest hours of content, you know,

02:17.770 --> 02:23.590
many, many lectures, tens of lectures, because they are so in-depth and there is so much history.

02:23.590 --> 02:30.490
And as this protocol evolve and I won't do their justice if I started just, you know, talking about

02:30.490 --> 02:36.340
them, you know, like in detail here, this is not the venue for it.

02:36.340 --> 02:39.640
I think they deserve to be their own courses.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.910
Then in the future maybe I'll start working on that.

02:43.120 --> 02:51.880
But for that it's they do deserve an honorable mention to be mentioned in this course at least, and

02:51.880 --> 02:58.030
given like an overview, maybe five, 10 minutes, very high level summary.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.620
I won't go into details.

02:59.890 --> 03:06.130
I'll pick one protocol and you're going to see lectures filled as you progress through the course.

03:06.610 --> 03:12.340
Whenever I have time, I'm going to add more lectures and based on your, you know, requests.

03:12.340 --> 03:12.760
Really.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.360
So how about we jump into this section, guys?

03:16.750 --> 03:17.440
Enjoy.
