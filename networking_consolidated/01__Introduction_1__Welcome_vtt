Welcome and thank you so much for checking out this cause.

00:02.460 --> 00:10.710
My name is Hussein and I have built this course specifically for people like myself who are back in

00:10.710 --> 00:17.190
engineers, you know, software engineer, frontend engineers who started up directly programming and

00:17.190 --> 00:24.960
building network applications without really fully grasping and understanding the fundamentals of networking.

00:24.960 --> 00:31.740
You know, I spent over 17 years, you know, just using and building software, designing and architecting

00:31.740 --> 00:32.340
back ends.

00:32.760 --> 00:40.140
But only recently in the past five years, I actually decided to completely grasp what it what I, why

00:40.140 --> 00:44.820
I'm what am I really interacting with, you know, what are these network stack?

00:45.150 --> 00:48.480
What are the limitations of the network that we have today?

00:48.690 --> 00:49.440
So like what's going on?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.210
What is a TCP handshake?

00:51.210 --> 00:55.530
What is an acknowledgement why sometimes that connection is slower, sometimes it's fast.

00:55.800 --> 01:02.270
All these questions, you know, it became it became really frustrating at a certain point that I don't

01:02.280 --> 01:03.570
really understand that.

01:03.810 --> 01:12.720
And the courses that we took in the university really kind of it was so dry and they fed you this networking

01:12.720 --> 01:18.640
concept, but you really don't have anything to hook on to kind of relate to, you know?

01:18.670 --> 01:21.460
Yeah, this is a TCP window, but okay, okay, why?

01:21.480 --> 01:25.560
Why does it have to do anything with me as a computer science student?

01:25.560 --> 01:29.370
You know, there is a bridge that is missing.

01:29.790 --> 01:40.290
And and I spent some time trying to craft a course specifically to bridge that gap between back in engineers

01:40.500 --> 01:42.360
and network engineering.

01:42.360 --> 01:49.020
It's a self because I do believe network engineering is one of the most critical concept to understand.

01:49.020 --> 01:53.580
If you're a back an engineer and if you're a front end engineer, you know, and definitely if you are

01:53.580 --> 02:01.860
a full stack, you know, just understand what is underneath the first principle, first principle building

02:01.860 --> 02:02.700
blocks.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.710
And this is what this course is for.

02:04.920 --> 02:12.330
So in summary, I kind of built this course for my old self, you know, when I was a little bit frustrated

02:12.330 --> 02:19.140
about things that I don't really understand, you know, it comes to the TCP stack and the IP stack

02:19.140 --> 02:25.440
and the UDP and TCP protocols and and all these small concepts that really critical to understand.

02:25.440 --> 02:31.080
Layer seven, layer four, layer three, layer six, you know, all these concepts that really shows

02:31.080 --> 02:35.430
up every day when you are a back end engineer, specifically if you're in a DevOps, you know.

02:35.700 --> 02:40.290
But so I kind of built this course for that with that thing in mind.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.320
Thank you so much for checking it out again and I hope you enjoy it.
