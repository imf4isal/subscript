All right, guys, let me talk about this section a little bit.

00:02.730 --> 00:05.280
Networking, consent for effective back in applications.

00:05.550 --> 00:12.210
Finally, we reach the bridge that we want to cross between the network engineering fundamental responsible

00:12.210 --> 00:19.710
concept that we talked about for a few sections now and now the actual practical, you know, linkage

00:19.710 --> 00:26.040
by which we end things that we encounter on a daily basis.

00:26.160 --> 00:32.460
Performance, latency, effectiveness, all of these things we're going to understand by taking these

00:32.670 --> 00:40.470
real life examples, which has some some resemblance of the networking and the back end engineering

00:40.770 --> 00:41.380
concept.

00:41.460 --> 00:47.970
So while we did mention most of these concepts across the lectures, you know, this is where I try

00:47.970 --> 00:54.990
as much as possible to cement these ideas and kind of link them to practical back end applications and

00:54.990 --> 00:55.920
front end application.

00:55.920 --> 01:01.740
Because those is going to show up because guess what, TCP or UDP are the communication or two sizes,

01:01.740 --> 01:02.680
not just one, right?

01:02.910 --> 01:07.680
So there are configurations that you can do in the client side that kind of at the back end and vice

01:07.740 --> 01:08.190
versa.

01:08.250 --> 01:14.550
So this is a very critical section I'm going to talk about in detail, talk about all these concept

01:14.550 --> 01:18.030
algorithms that affect and this section is going to continue to grow.

01:18.270 --> 01:23.100
These are a few lectures right now, but we're going to continue to grow and add and add more to it.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.510
How about we jump into it?

01:24.510 --> 01:25.260
Let's jump into it.
