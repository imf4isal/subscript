00:00.090 --> 00:01.500
Hey, guys, what's going on?

00:01.530 --> 00:05.720
So I wasn't on a trip recently.

00:05.730 --> 00:14.010
I connected to the airplane wi fi, and I got this information on my phone, and I thought I was like,

00:14.010 --> 00:19.260
you know what might be a good idea to talk through this in a lecture, in a specific lecture, so I

00:19.260 --> 00:25.200
can show you the link, the real world with whatever we've been talking about in this course.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.580
And I thought it would be a good idea.

00:26.580 --> 00:28.770
I know hopefully you guys enjoy this.

00:28.770 --> 00:38.190
So when I connect it to this Alaska Wi-Fi, give me a IP address, a subnet mask and a router.

00:38.190 --> 00:43.920
So if you notice this IP address is private or my my, you might say, how do you know?

00:44.070 --> 00:48.450
Well, the list of private IP addresses are well defined and well known.

00:48.450 --> 00:52.080
So let's go through them a little bit before we actually go back to the picture here.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.930
So these are the well known private IP address.

00:54.930 --> 01:01.290
That means if they ever detected on the public Internet, they will be dropped.

01:01.290 --> 01:07.440
That doesn't make any sense to send IP packets with these IP addresses in the Internet.

01:07.860 --> 01:12.180
They only make sense in local configuration effectively.

01:13.710 --> 01:22.320
And some of the common thing is you might have seen this 10.000 up until ten 224525, four or five.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.400
This is the whole range.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.620
So it's the 24 bit block.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.650
So that's the host size, but it's slash eight.

01:28.650 --> 01:29.430
Effectively.

01:29.430 --> 01:35.250
When I say slash eight, we talked about this, it means the first eight bits, right?

01:35.250 --> 01:44.790
Because this is eight eight, eight, 832 because IP for the first eight bit is the network portion

01:44.790 --> 01:49.830
and that will what will basically create the mask which will define our network.

01:50.070 --> 01:53.730
So we have this much addresses, right, because you can do the math.

01:54.720 --> 02:02.310
The second network actually it's more interesting, it starts with 172 and starts 16.

02:02.850 --> 02:03.810
What does that mean?

02:03.850 --> 02:04.180
Right.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.520
It's it's actually a 12 bit network.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.970
So you take the first wolf bit from the left.

02:11.970 --> 02:13.290
That's your network.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.590
So that's eight plus four.

02:16.800 --> 02:21.150
And those guys defined the last bit, you know.

02:21.150 --> 02:28.800
So let me bring in the calculator programming calculator so I can show you exactly what I mean here.

02:28.800 --> 02:34.080
So the 16 the value 16 here, if you noticed, is what is this?

02:34.080 --> 02:34.440
Right.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.030
So that's the that's the bit.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.990
So this is part of your network.

02:39.990 --> 02:43.350
But this as a result has to be one, right?

02:43.350 --> 02:50.250
You start from one and this four bits and the rest of the eight bits here and another eight base which

02:50.250 --> 02:56.070
is 20 total bits because you have 16 bits and four you have 20 total bit.

02:56.070 --> 03:04.320
You can start adding 11111000 and then 1000 and until it reaches 1111, all of them.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.760
So what is the last bit?

03:05.760 --> 03:09.230
If you think about it, the last bit will be 31, right?

03:09.240 --> 03:12.720
Because all of them this has to remain one.

03:13.440 --> 03:20.220
That's why 172, it's 16.00 up until 172, 31 to 2 five five and to five five.

03:20.220 --> 03:23.310
So that's that's the private that's that second subnet.

03:23.310 --> 03:24.270
That is private.

03:24.450 --> 03:27.270
So if you ever seen.

03:28.830 --> 03:31.270
As 001111.

03:31.320 --> 03:41.160
That's just a normal IP if you ever seen, for example, 32.32 or 33 or anything above that, that's

03:41.160 --> 03:43.620
just a normal public IP address.

03:43.770 --> 03:45.570
They've got to be careful with that here.

03:45.900 --> 03:51.660
So now obviously the last one is a slash 16, which is the 192168.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.060
That's other popular private.

03:53.070 --> 03:54.160
What are we seeing here?

03:54.180 --> 03:57.510
We're seeing that we are, as we were assigned, one 17.19.

03:57.510 --> 03:58.950
So it's within the range.

03:58.950 --> 04:00.600
This is 16 to 31.

04:00.600 --> 04:08.700
So that's the range and that one, 31.48 because any these can be anything as long as this is the range

04:08.700 --> 04:10.200
from 16 to 31.

04:10.200 --> 04:10.620
Right.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.720
So that's that's what we're seeing here.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.000
And this is the router.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.620
That means this is the gateway.

04:18.340 --> 04:27.970
And we talked about what they did is gateway, whereas if you are sending a an IP packet which contains

04:27.970 --> 04:35.200
anything at TCP IP, you know, connection or database or, you know, just TB request, the destination

04:35.230 --> 04:42.460
IP address, if I apply the subnet and it's not in my network, all bets are off, I send it to my router

04:42.670 --> 04:50.020
and that default gateway should better know how to handle it and talk to them, send it to other networks

04:50.020 --> 04:50.560
as well.

04:51.610 --> 04:52.750
So that's the definition.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.270
So here, look at this.

04:56.300 --> 04:56.750
Right.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.080
The root are defined the subnet mask here.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.090
And this has nothing to do with this, by the way, guys.

05:02.090 --> 05:02.420
Right.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.770
This is the subnet mask.

05:04.790 --> 05:09.020
What is the question here is how many hosts?

05:10.120 --> 05:12.670
Do you think this airplane can't carry?

05:13.180 --> 05:17.800
If you think about it, well, we have zero here.

05:17.830 --> 05:20.440
That means this is eight bits.

05:20.480 --> 05:20.980
Right.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.930
And then this is 254.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.280
What is 254?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.890
Let's bring out the calculator again.

05:25.900 --> 05:29.080
Why did I close it to 54?

05:29.560 --> 05:30.250
Look at this.

05:31.590 --> 05:32.670
254.

05:32.880 --> 05:37.830
All of these values, all of these values are set except this one.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.040
So this is the network portion.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.050
And obviously, this is also two five, five, two, five, five.

05:44.130 --> 05:44.500
Right.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.230
So I said so this is 11111111111, one one.

05:49.260 --> 05:51.360
Except that last bit.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.310
So we have a free bit here.

05:53.700 --> 05:59.910
So the host side is the eight bit right here, plus an additional bit.

05:59.910 --> 06:01.620
So we have nine bits.

06:02.100 --> 06:09.450
So if you take two to the power of nine, that gives you, what, two?

06:10.270 --> 06:11.850
If 512.

06:11.860 --> 06:12.310
Right.

06:12.910 --> 06:14.140
Well, switch.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.020
There isn't a power here in the programmers one.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.360
Oh, man.

06:19.390 --> 06:19.780
No.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.150
Right to.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.100
To the power.

06:22.120 --> 06:22.440
Yeah.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.550
Programmers don't like to do power, apparently.

06:24.550 --> 06:24.780
Right.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.110
Like, come on, come on, come on.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.000
Give me a power here.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.460
So if you're 512, so that's it.

06:32.790 --> 06:38.340
So based on the, I guess, number of seats and the number of devices, they said, okay, they could

06:38.340 --> 06:45.140
have gone with two, five, five here, which gives them one 256 addresses or IP addresses that, but

06:45.150 --> 06:46.140
that's a little bit low.

06:46.140 --> 06:50.160
So they just added an additional bit and that gives them an additional 256.

06:50.700 --> 06:58.680
Yeah, I just find it interesting to kind of look at these and actually linking reality, linking the

06:58.680 --> 07:05.940
real life with what we actually studied because this is what we miss effectively in the, in all the

07:05.940 --> 07:06.470
courses.

07:06.480 --> 07:12.360
Even in my personal studies like 20 years ago when I, when you went to university, it's like, yeah,

07:12.360 --> 07:17.130
you keep teaching us this IP address, but I, I don't know, what do they mean?

07:17.310 --> 07:19.020
It's like, what does that mean?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.770
Link it to the real world and I'll try.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.870
I might fail, obviously, but some.

07:24.870 --> 07:26.010
Sometimes I try here.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.540
So here.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.350
If.

07:29.370 --> 07:37.080
Well, if if passengers brought, I don't know, five if each passenger, let's say the, uh, the aircraft

07:37.080 --> 07:45.030
carries on and all 200 passengers, if each passengers brought two devices and connected to the wi fi.

07:45.060 --> 07:48.180
That's what that's 400 IP addresses, right?

07:48.660 --> 07:53.430
If each passenger brought three devices and they connected, then it's 600.

07:53.910 --> 07:55.440
That will fail.

07:55.440 --> 07:59.760
Effectively, the router will run all the IP addresses.

07:59.760 --> 08:04.260
In that particular case, what they think about is like, okay, what are the chances that this might

08:04.260 --> 08:04.620
fail?

08:05.040 --> 08:13.200
And the second thing that one will I want to discuss later is I'd ask how Wi-Fi actually prevent me

08:13.710 --> 08:15.240
from accessing.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.460
Certain services, right?

08:20.040 --> 08:27.440
They they allow me to use WhatsApp and messages and certain messages to do text only.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.220
But.

08:29.250 --> 08:35.130
They block request to do any images.

08:35.310 --> 08:38.640
I can't browse anything in the web, so port four for three is closed.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.450
Funny enough, I think port 80 is open for some reason.

08:42.450 --> 08:49.650
So they allow it to connect insecure so they can effectively sniff any traffic you might have, but

08:49.650 --> 08:50.820
they block four for three.

08:50.820 --> 08:57.600
So anything secure you can do DNS, you can do it, you can do the and support 53 is open but the for

08:57.600 --> 09:03.690
the WhatsApp and I messages I looked up and actually those guys the services they built these messages

09:03.690 --> 09:05.970
they do it on different ports.

09:06.770 --> 09:07.970
Which is fascinating.

09:08.150 --> 09:09.590
So what's up?

09:09.590 --> 09:11.360
Want to try to retrieve text?

09:11.360 --> 09:17.120
It uses certain port, but if it tries to retrieve images, it uses a different port.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.290
It uses a different set of, you know, services.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.480
And those is well defined ports.

09:23.480 --> 09:32.420
And I think this is all an agreement between the Y for between the airplanes and basically like firewall

09:32.420 --> 09:38.450
services, you know, big companies and those messaging services like OC, please separate them because

09:38.450 --> 09:39.290
if they don't.

09:40.620 --> 09:47.220
When a when an IP packet in a segment in this case goes through the router and it goes to all one port,

09:47.250 --> 09:49.270
you don't know what that means, right?

09:49.290 --> 09:55.680
So by separating the application to give it like meaning based based on a port, they can block certain

09:55.680 --> 10:00.870
ports and allow others and as a result, block images, but allow text.

10:01.290 --> 10:01.950
It's fascinating.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.710
So we're going to talk about this maybe in another lecture.

10:04.740 --> 10:05.820
Hope you enjoy this one.

10:06.620 --> 10:08.050
I'm going to see in the next one.
