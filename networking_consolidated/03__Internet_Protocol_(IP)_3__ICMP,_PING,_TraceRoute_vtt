00:00.090 --> 00:00.840
All right, guys.

00:01.320 --> 00:06.750
ICMP is one of the most critical protocols that lives in layer three.

00:07.230 --> 00:11.730
And we talked about it a lot, but this is where we actually explain it.

00:12.270 --> 00:14.670
If you ever used Ping, that's ICMP.

00:14.970 --> 00:17.280
If you ever use Traceroute, that's ICMP.

00:17.280 --> 00:23.250
We're going to demystify this protocol and talk about how critical this thing is, how we jump into

00:23.250 --> 00:23.370
it.

00:24.520 --> 00:30.370
So ICMP stands for the Internet Control Message Protocol and lives in layer three domains.

00:30.790 --> 00:31.480
What does that mean?

00:32.770 --> 00:36.360
It means only there is a destination and source IPA.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.280
There is no concept of ports at that layer.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.480
There is no ports.

00:40.480 --> 00:41.560
There are no ports.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.890
Well, so just for information, messages between host.

00:45.900 --> 00:46.530
Beautiful.

00:47.010 --> 00:48.280
No, just very critical.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.600
That's why when I now we have the same language, we talk the same language.

00:51.610 --> 00:54.810
When I say layer three, we you understand what that means.

00:55.170 --> 00:57.360
When I say layer four, immediately ports.

00:57.660 --> 00:58.410
Think of ports.

00:58.410 --> 01:00.750
You know, think of DCP, think of congestion control.

01:00.750 --> 01:01.530
Think of that stuff.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.400
We're going to become more clear as the course goes.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.640
Designed for informational messages, hosted.

01:08.670 --> 01:09.150
Reachable.

01:09.330 --> 01:13.290
Hey, you send a message to a host that doesn't exist.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.320
ICMP Port Unreachable.

01:16.890 --> 01:23.790
Although port is a layer four concept, the ICMP is a layer three concept that is sent back from the

01:23.790 --> 01:24.210
server.

01:24.660 --> 01:33.270
So if you try to reach a port on a server that doesn't exist, it will send a ICMP message back if that's

01:33.270 --> 01:38.250
enabled, unless they had port unreachable, hosted, unreachable, fragmentation needed.

01:38.250 --> 01:42.120
We spent 5 minutes talking about that fragmentation.

01:42.270 --> 01:46.740
Hey, you need to fragment your packet because it's too large for them to you.

01:47.520 --> 01:54.150
Packet expiry, infinite loop and routers like hey, this is the time to live thing that we talked about,

01:54.150 --> 01:54.420
right?

01:54.810 --> 01:59.310
Until if we keep a decrement they trigger and they decrement thing until it reaches the head and then

01:59.310 --> 02:00.170
hey, back.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.560
It expired at zero.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.220
It's dead.

02:02.820 --> 02:09.660
You send an ICMP message so all the time uses IP directly ping and trace it out, uses it.

02:10.440 --> 02:15.030
We talked about that doesn't it doesn't require listeners or port to be opened.

02:15.030 --> 02:17.070
I love to add this kind of concept.

02:17.280 --> 02:21.450
You'll never find anything else this because our people take this for granted.

02:21.450 --> 02:23.520
But I like to kind of emphasize these point.

02:23.790 --> 02:26.730
There is no port to listen to get the ICMP messages.

02:27.030 --> 02:34.170
You know, you can send an ICMP message any time you want, as long as the host itself enables ICMP,

02:34.470 --> 02:39.570
that means IP packets with IP packets with the protocol set to ICMP.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.310
No ports, nothing like that.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.940
You can send these echo messages all you want.

02:44.940 --> 02:48.180
You know, this is how the ICMP header looks like.

02:48.390 --> 02:55.260
This is they're basically I throw this from the RC 792 can look at the ICMP message the very simple

02:55.260 --> 02:59.400
you know, there's a four by four octet as they say it.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.880
Right that one for a one by two by three by.

03:02.880 --> 03:10.650
So there's a white for the code obviously you can have up to 255 code, write a type of the message.

03:10.650 --> 03:14.310
Just the thing goes, this is the type, the subtype if you will know.

03:14.520 --> 03:20.430
And this is a list of everything here and all the list is here effectively checksum whether this message

03:20.430 --> 03:21.330
was corrupted or not.

03:21.840 --> 03:26.010
Rest of the headers, you know, some firewalls block ICMP for security reasons.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.340
You know, a lot of you know, that's the sad thing about the Internet.

03:29.340 --> 03:34.920
You know, you build something cool, you can't have nice things and then you build nice things and

03:34.920 --> 03:38.310
attackers find an exploit to use ICMP for bad thing.

03:38.430 --> 03:44.730
You know, some people use that for to do flooding attacks you know, to flood ICMP messages Desert

03:44.730 --> 03:50.820
Observer some use it some some some used it for back channel attacks to kind of probe the server has

03:51.270 --> 03:54.390
to find certain ports that are enabled.

03:54.390 --> 04:02.430
You know, just some firewalls actually block ICMP or some some some firewalls, time out ICMP messages

04:02.430 --> 04:07.290
like, okay, you can't you're doing a lot of ICMP requests right now.

04:07.290 --> 04:14.370
So I'm going to time you off for I think for our for example, this is why Bing might not work in these

04:14.370 --> 04:14.700
cases.

04:14.700 --> 04:21.060
So ever wonder that you pinging a machine that you absolutely know it's alive but your ping is not going

04:21.060 --> 04:21.360
through?

04:21.930 --> 04:25.020
It could be that it's not going through because the host is not available.

04:25.440 --> 04:31.320
But most of the time ping one of the packets, right.

04:31.320 --> 04:35.790
The router that you're going, your ping is going through your IP because ping is just an IP packet

04:35.790 --> 04:41.430
that has ICMP really nothing, nothing fancy there.

04:42.060 --> 04:48.510
And what it does is, is say, hey, one of those routers, drop the IP because I'll be back because

04:48.510 --> 04:49.920
the ICMP is blocked.

04:51.570 --> 04:55.770
So disabling ICMP can also cause real damage with connection establishment.

04:57.570 --> 05:00.330
This is called the TCP blackhole, effectively.

05:00.510 --> 05:02.610
So you would establish the connection, right?

05:03.030 --> 05:04.040
But then you started.

05:04.060 --> 05:09.390
So TCP IP through a handshake is we're going to talk about about but is tiny you know the data you're

05:09.390 --> 05:11.340
sending is so send and second.

05:11.880 --> 05:12.160
Right.

05:12.510 --> 05:16.470
But then so so that passes because your IP back is so tiny.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.050
But the moment you stop sending real data.

05:19.440 --> 05:19.740
Right.

05:20.400 --> 05:20.640
Right.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.020
And you say don't fragment.

05:23.290 --> 05:28.000
And then one of the empty use and the devices are so small and you need to fragment.

05:28.720 --> 05:36.340
The router will send will try to send you a message ICMP message saying hey, your, your, your IP

05:36.340 --> 05:39.790
packet is so large for my home to you, please make it smaller.

05:40.030 --> 05:40.660
But guess what?

05:40.660 --> 05:42.910
ICMP is blocked, right?

05:42.940 --> 05:46.870
If it's blocked, you will never reach you will never get the ICMP message.

05:47.020 --> 05:52.240
So all of a sudden you see that TB connection open, but your data is not going through what the heck

05:52.240 --> 05:52.780
is going on?

05:52.780 --> 05:54.100
It's like you open a black hole.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.170
That's literally what is called TCP black hole.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.180
Google it and we're going to do a ping demo a little bit in a minute here.

06:01.450 --> 06:02.950
Let me let me ping something here.

06:03.220 --> 06:08.140
I'm going to ping pong is available on literally every operating system, so let's pick something less.

06:08.140 --> 06:08.500
Bang.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.950
19.168.2524.245.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.150
Or this is actually my router.

06:13.840 --> 06:21.220
So if you see this ping will send an ICMP sequence message, you know, and it will specify a title.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.280
Hey, we know this stuff now, right?

06:24.310 --> 06:26.710
TTL time to level 64.

06:27.660 --> 06:32.850
Title Time to live iterations and ascending 64 bytes.

06:33.390 --> 06:33.750
Right.

06:33.990 --> 06:41.910
And this is the time it takes from for the ICMP to reach this router and from the router back to me

06:41.910 --> 06:43.020
and a six millisecond.

06:43.380 --> 06:46.260
If you think about this a little bit slow, my daughter is right over there.

06:46.290 --> 06:47.520
Why is it taking me?

06:47.730 --> 06:49.050
Maybe through the Wi-Fi.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.250
Because I connect to the Wi-Fi.

06:50.970 --> 06:51.540
But look at this.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.240
Sometimes 11 milliseconds, sometimes 12.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.040
That is nuts.

06:56.130 --> 06:57.660
You know, but this is the ICMP sequence.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.360
It's beautiful to understand this stuff, right?

07:00.840 --> 07:01.770
So ICMP let's let's.

07:01.770 --> 07:02.130
Bingo.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.960
Google does comping google.com.

07:04.410 --> 07:08.440
So what pink does is like first of all, ping only works with IP addresses.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.660
Google.com is not IP.

07:09.660 --> 07:12.000
And also it does a DNS finds the IP address.

07:12.600 --> 07:12.810
Right.

07:12.810 --> 07:14.400
So Bing does more work here.

07:14.790 --> 07:15.690
Give me the IP address.

07:15.690 --> 07:21.900
And now we ping it and notice that it decided to do a larger deal.

07:21.930 --> 07:25.980
Now, just because they're Google, I guess it's farther.

07:25.980 --> 07:31.830
So it will estimate that let me put a larger title and this is like, look at this.

07:32.400 --> 07:38.340
Google is almost as close to my Rather it's like 12 minute, nine millisecond and my daughter is six

07:38.340 --> 07:38.880
millisecond.

07:39.180 --> 07:45.870
I really need to check like why is my routing is so slow and I need maybe to upgrade my router.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.320
Now, but this is really interesting, so I'll get back to the slides.

07:52.570 --> 07:53.890
All right, Pang.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.020
This is how Bing works.

07:56.740 --> 07:56.880
Right.

07:58.030 --> 07:59.620
This is the destination server.

08:00.100 --> 08:00.370
All right.

08:00.640 --> 08:06.520
Let's explain this beautiful diagram that I spent so much time trying to draw because I'm not a very

08:06.520 --> 08:07.270
good animator.

08:08.350 --> 08:08.680
Right.

08:08.710 --> 08:10.570
As you might have noticed already.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.070
So 192161 200 is the first.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.720
Rather, that three dot hundred is a second rather.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.680
So this is an ad network.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.840
This is a network.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.560
And these are their puppy devices for that network.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.070
Why don't you do the five video?

08:26.390 --> 08:30.630
These are that network and these are the devices tender handler.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.620
This is another net or so they were connected.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.720
We're connecting many networks together.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.390
So as we talked about, this, rather belongs to two networks.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.170
Right.

08:38.410 --> 08:39.610
This guy and this guy.

08:39.790 --> 08:42.910
The other belongs to two networks with rather built to do network.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.300
This rather to belong to one network.

08:45.310 --> 08:45.610
Right.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.590
And this is just one of the devices.

08:48.220 --> 08:54.820
So if I send a packet, what do we do is like I sent a total hundred ICMP echo request.

08:54.830 --> 08:55.840
That's what it means, right?

08:56.080 --> 08:58.930
Hey, I want to go to 19216, eight or 10 to 3.

08:59.260 --> 09:00.010
So this guy.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.650
190.168.123.

09:02.950 --> 09:05.290
We do all this shebang that we talked about.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.120
No, do the subnet mask.

09:07.330 --> 09:08.560
Are you in my subnet?

09:08.860 --> 09:09.820
No, you're not.

09:10.060 --> 09:10.990
Let me send it.

09:11.020 --> 09:11.380
Right.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.680
And with the message, the packet will reach there.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.540
And we're going to decrement all the TTL.

09:16.550 --> 09:16.810
Right.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.090
So from 100, we reach 96.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.500
So, one, two, three, four.

09:20.510 --> 09:20.800
Right.

09:20.890 --> 09:21.370
Makes sense.

09:21.370 --> 09:21.640
Right.

09:21.670 --> 09:24.160
And I'm not sure if the host actually decrement that or not.

09:24.460 --> 09:30.010
We can we can we can study that and make sure like, okay, there is it 95 or 96.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.570
I really don't know.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.520
But I know that outers decrement the details.

09:33.710 --> 09:34.900
You know how we reach that.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.240
So that's that's helping.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.280
So we got the echo that server.

09:39.280 --> 09:44.770
If it supports ICMP, it will respond back with an ICMP echo or apply again.

09:44.770 --> 09:52.120
Or he said the TTL, the source, the destination is 1921688123 and the source is ten two three.

09:52.690 --> 09:58.510
Do all the subnet mask shebang and then boom, send it over and we get it.

09:58.900 --> 09:59.800
That's helping works.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.380
Let's go.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.070
A ping that is unreachable.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.290
I'm sending 219216 at a tender three, which is right there.

10:08.590 --> 10:10.870
And one of the two it is the one 1.1 to 3.

10:11.320 --> 10:11.590
Right.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.850
But look at the TTL.

10:12.970 --> 10:19.000
I just set it to three specifically just to time it out for for testing reasons here.

10:19.300 --> 10:27.040
So it which is here becomes to the packet reaches here, the router determines it becomes one right

10:27.280 --> 10:28.030
reaches here.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.770
Thereafter the committed becomes zero.

10:30.440 --> 10:30.750
This is.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.050
Wait a minute.

10:33.220 --> 10:34.130
It's not reachable.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.110
I have to drop it.

10:35.470 --> 10:44.710
So the router before it drops it, it drops it and then sends at an ICMP destination unreachable ICMP

10:44.710 --> 10:47.770
message because just an IP packet is just an IP packet.

10:47.770 --> 10:48.460
That's a beauty.

10:48.790 --> 10:52.290
Everything is just an IP packet to the layer three or outers here.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.700
You we sending all this beautiful stuff.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.160
192168.123.

10:58.060 --> 11:01.780
Target is where I want you to send it back to.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.100
Yeah, look at this.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.900
We're sending what is sending to whoever the source was.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.170
But who is the source here now?

11:08.380 --> 11:09.640
This all becomes this, rather.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.250
When I don't succeed, it's 500.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.500
So now look at this.

11:15.070 --> 11:24.640
So now we got the machine, got back another packet, but it knows who sent it.

11:25.630 --> 11:34.900
This is the whole implementation of Try It Out because because the title dies right here and because

11:34.900 --> 11:39.910
that router sends back and ICMP destination unreachable or whatever.

11:41.230 --> 11:47.110
What happens here is effectively the we know who sent us, right?

11:47.440 --> 11:52.510
We know where the packet dies and that's beautiful.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.240
Might trace it out or route.

11:56.140 --> 12:00.040
Can you identify the entire path your IP packet takes?

12:00.990 --> 12:02.940
That's the question, Tracy, and I'll try to answer.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.210
Clever use of video right now.

12:06.330 --> 12:06.920
No problem.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.130
Just explain it a lot.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.560
Incremental slowly.

12:10.740 --> 12:13.920
And you will get the router IP address for each hop.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.400
So start with the one you're going to get immediately, right?

12:17.400 --> 12:22.620
Because that will decrement that VH zero and will immediately respond back with an ICMP message.

12:22.620 --> 12:22.830
Right.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.680
Doesn't always work as the path changes.

12:26.010 --> 12:26.400
Right.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.320
And ICMP might be blocked.

12:28.320 --> 12:28.590
Right.

12:28.950 --> 12:29.910
That's the problem here.

12:30.330 --> 12:33.600
Because if those emby is blocked, you're done.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.650
You cannot do anything.

12:35.340 --> 12:44.130
But the other thing is your packet might take one round, but the second title that you send might take

12:44.130 --> 12:46.680
another route, so it might get the wrong result.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.020
So Trace path is not really 100% correct.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.350
And here's an animation I did for the trace lot.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.960
So what do you do is we send a TTL.

12:55.110 --> 12:56.640
You saw this animation.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.870
I'm going to do it again because I wanted to appreciate my beautiful animation.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.000
Look at this TTL one.

13:03.120 --> 13:09.330
We send it one echo, send it to that destination and that immediately we get response from who?

13:09.960 --> 13:12.900
100 says a destination.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.070
I'm reachable, man.

13:15.240 --> 13:15.600
Why?

13:15.600 --> 13:16.890
Because we set it as one.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.900
We immediately document that and we're done.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.990
So now we know that my packet passed through this guy.

13:23.850 --> 13:24.390
All right.

13:24.750 --> 13:25.800
Let me make it to.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.570
Now it survives.

13:27.570 --> 13:29.850
The first doubter minus one.

13:30.420 --> 13:36.990
It doesn't survive the second because minus one and then minus one becomes zero, because you send two,

13:37.380 --> 13:38.550
and then it dies right here.

13:39.030 --> 13:41.090
And now we get the second, rather.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.300
So we have the first.

13:43.170 --> 13:43.800
This is out, right?

13:43.800 --> 13:44.340
And it works.

13:44.610 --> 13:46.730
We know the first hope is this.

13:46.740 --> 13:47.670
The second help is this.

13:48.120 --> 13:48.440
All right.

13:48.450 --> 13:49.230
What's the third top?

13:49.470 --> 13:50.370
That's three.

13:50.790 --> 13:52.290
Then boom, boom, boom.

13:53.070 --> 13:53.340
Right.

13:53.350 --> 13:56.670
We give this four, we get it here.

13:57.300 --> 14:01.200
And then finally five, we're going to get an echo reply from the actual one.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.420
That means, hey, we actually find the destination, right?

14:03.900 --> 14:06.450
And that's pretty much it.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.430
You know, how about we do a demo?

14:10.620 --> 14:11.040
Clear.

14:13.010 --> 14:13.970
Uh, Trace.

14:14.630 --> 14:16.010
Artie, I.

14:16.170 --> 14:17.450
I believe it's in windows.

14:17.450 --> 14:21.160
Call Trace Artie in Mac and Linux could trace it out.

14:21.170 --> 14:22.250
So trace it out.

14:22.550 --> 14:23.330
Google dot com.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.110
Let's do something else.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.990
Do I have another network here?

14:27.200 --> 14:31.130
If I out my router, that's kind of pointless because there is only one hope.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.210
But let's do it.

14:32.780 --> 14:33.320
Exactly.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.240
So my gateway is immediately that right?

14:35.600 --> 14:36.020
So that's.

14:36.020 --> 14:36.500
That's.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.460
That's kind of pointless, but let's try it out.

14:40.940 --> 14:41.420
Yeah, let's.

14:41.420 --> 14:41.900
3000.

14:41.900 --> 14:42.540
Another machine.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.840
Do I have another machine?

14:44.870 --> 14:45.770
I believe I do.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.060
All right, try this.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.230
I'm going to transfer out my other Mac book right here.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.510
254 to 10, I believe.

14:53.520 --> 14:53.870
Right.

14:54.380 --> 14:55.660
And immediately, look at this beauty.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.370
So traceroute to this, right?

14:58.820 --> 15:01.700
We immediately go to that, right?

15:01.730 --> 15:07.610
There is no other hop despite us actually going through that outer because that's what we have to go

15:07.610 --> 15:09.860
through that outer to reach my packet.

15:09.860 --> 15:13.400
But my router here acted like a switch, right?

15:13.910 --> 15:16.730
If it acts like a switch, it goes up to what, layer two.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.520
So it never actually reaches a layer three.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.410
So there is no detail.

15:21.410 --> 15:26.720
The detail doesn't get affected if you're sending something to the same net or very critical to understand

15:26.730 --> 15:26.840
it.

15:26.840 --> 15:27.080
Right.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.940
Very, very, very important.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.840
Let's write out something, I guess, and another network.

15:33.290 --> 15:33.980
Can you hear me?

15:34.010 --> 15:34.280
All right?

15:34.970 --> 15:35.690
Google dot com.

15:35.690 --> 15:37.670
Sure, definitely.

15:38.060 --> 15:46.220
The first hop now is the gateway because wipe one fourth with the 50 to 72.142 is definitely not in

15:46.220 --> 15:46.860
my subnet.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.210
Why?

15:47.420 --> 15:50.930
Because my subnet has two five, five, two, five out of five is not me.

15:50.930 --> 15:57.080
So immediately we got to this as probably I'm going to block all this stuff because all of this is my

15:57.080 --> 15:59.030
ISP and I don't want to show any of this stuff.

15:59.510 --> 15:59.840
Right.

16:01.070 --> 16:01.460
But.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.280
It shows probably everything here, right?

16:05.340 --> 16:09.750
Shows you all the path that it took, all that until it reaches Google.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.020
Right.

16:10.320 --> 16:17.790
Now, I'm going to block part of this here for security reasons, but so I'm going to block a part of

16:17.790 --> 16:18.300
this stuff.

16:18.300 --> 16:24.000
But you can see that eventually we reached the Google network here.

16:24.870 --> 16:25.440
All right.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.090
How about we summarize?

16:27.480 --> 16:28.980
So what is ICMP?

16:29.070 --> 16:35.100
That's an IP level protocol that is used to send information back and forth.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.490
Very critical protocol.

16:36.510 --> 16:40.860
Fortunately, some browsers, some firewalls block it.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.960
And if it's blocked, that means you cannot ping.

16:42.960 --> 16:48.660
You cannot send critical information, messages that you can get into weird situations ping and try

16:48.750 --> 16:57.210
it out uses it don't fragment fragmentation needed all these messages it will use to tell you that whether

16:57.210 --> 17:04.980
your host is reachable or not, no port is reachable or not, you know, and that's basically very critical

17:04.980 --> 17:12.720
infrastructure, fundamental for responsible protocol that really needs to understand it so that you

17:12.720 --> 17:17.850
can explain things better when when it happens, you know, and in the future, who knows?

17:17.850 --> 17:25.080
Maybe we can extend this ICMP messages because we have so much tools in our, you know, as they could

17:25.080 --> 17:25.530
shed.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.350
But we never use this thing.

17:28.350 --> 17:31.350
We always build on top of other stuff.

17:31.350 --> 17:35.580
You know, I wonder if we can use the ICMP for our own purposes.

17:35.850 --> 17:38.910
Now on to the next lecture.
