WEBVTT

00:00.030 --> 00:03.840
It won't be a networking course without actually explaining around the example.

00:04.530 --> 00:05.830
This is very critical too.

00:06.360 --> 00:14.280
I want to see how my packets are rooted in my between switches, between routers, between devices,

00:14.280 --> 00:15.930
how packets are flowing.

00:16.440 --> 00:21.920
So this lecture will be a routing example, for example, to explain how things actually works.

00:22.830 --> 00:27.690
Let's jump into the routing example, how IP packets are rooted in switches and routers.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.330
Very important that I said IP package.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.700
I'm not talking about connection here yet.

00:32.910 --> 00:42.150
No, it's just no matter what the protocol is, HDP, FTP is CDB, 3G, RTC, everything becomes an

00:42.150 --> 00:45.420
IP packet, everything is shoved into the segment.

00:46.230 --> 00:47.460
Everything will have ports.

00:47.460 --> 00:48.240
I don't care.

00:48.390 --> 00:52.590
The port becomes data as part of the IP and then will be shoved as an IP packet.

00:52.830 --> 00:53.400
With what?

00:54.420 --> 00:55.680
Destination IP address.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.750
So I suppose that's what all what I care about.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.890
And hey, we can explain this now.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.580
This is the configuration that we have today.

01:05.610 --> 01:06.330
So here's what I'm going to do.

01:06.450 --> 01:11.580
I'm going to send an IP back from A to B, which is this guy to this guy going to explain what will

01:11.580 --> 01:11.910
happen.

01:12.270 --> 01:16.380
I'm going to send a packet from D to X, which is this guy to this guy.

01:16.950 --> 01:17.280
All right.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.990
So that goes through a switch in order.

01:19.290 --> 01:28.110
And finally, from B to G, which is all the way outside, we're going to explain what all of this beauty

01:28.110 --> 01:28.380
is.

01:28.830 --> 01:33.560
How how about we jump into it, A, to B, first thing or scenario A to B?

01:33.570 --> 01:36.930
I'm going to explain from sending a packet from A to B.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.520
What does that mean?

01:38.910 --> 01:42.750
Well, if I'm sending epic A to B, all I need to know.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.730
I know the address.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.050
I need the Mac address.

01:46.050 --> 01:46.350
Right.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.640
What do we need to do?

01:47.670 --> 01:48.600
We do an ARP.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.210
Hey, everybody.

01:51.690 --> 01:56.820
Who has the route or who has the Mac?

01:57.000 --> 01:57.990
Who has the IP address?

01:57.990 --> 01:58.890
Ten 004.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.540
So will reply back.

02:00.810 --> 02:01.170
Right.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.200
So who who'll get the outbreak was because this guy will get it.

02:04.230 --> 02:05.400
This guy will get it this way.

02:05.430 --> 02:05.940
We'll get it.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.140
That's pretty much it.

02:07.980 --> 02:14.070
Our request won't traverse other networks because they are designed for local stuff.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.080
So this guy won't get it, you know?

02:16.860 --> 02:20.040
So we four of these guys will get it effectively, right?

02:20.730 --> 02:26.370
And the switch will be smart enough to understand where to send the packages, the packets to here.

02:27.510 --> 02:27.780
Let's.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.440
Let's go on.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.390
So now I know the Mac address of B, right.

02:30.780 --> 02:34.340
And before we we jump into that.

02:34.650 --> 02:36.900
No, A knows the Mac address of B ram.

02:37.440 --> 02:43.770
What also when all these machines power up they send a message with that a mac address.

02:44.550 --> 02:44.880
Right.

02:44.880 --> 02:51.000
As a board goes, hey, I am ten 005 and this is my IP address and this is my MAC address.

02:51.390 --> 02:51.750
So.

02:52.930 --> 03:00.370
CS directly connected to the switch so that it has a port B is connected to the switch, it has another

03:00.370 --> 03:03.910
port is connected, the switch has another port and so on.

03:04.510 --> 03:10.840
So as long as we keep sending some sort of data, any core a message, even if it's an ICMP message,

03:10.840 --> 03:12.040
anything, right?

03:12.490 --> 03:13.750
There should be anything.

03:14.580 --> 03:22.830
The switch will keep track of the Mac address belonging to the sport so it knows that.

03:22.860 --> 03:23.780
See, assume this.

03:23.790 --> 03:27.940
These letters are actually the MAC addresses or C is the MAC address of C effectively.

03:27.950 --> 03:34.170
And so the switch knows that this border, the C, this port is B, the sport is eight and this is the

03:34.170 --> 03:34.320
end.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.770
This port is ah which is the rather rather is just another device.

03:37.770 --> 03:38.730
So it has a mac address.

03:39.270 --> 03:45.510
So now this which is a layer two protocol, so it knows these MAC addresses, knows the frames.

03:46.140 --> 03:53.400
So now if I want to send A to B and I know the Mac address of B, I send a frame and I send an IP back

03:53.400 --> 03:55.590
in which tracks it and frame a single frame.

03:55.980 --> 03:56.940
No fragmentation.

03:57.480 --> 04:03.660
My packet goes here, goes to this, which the switch will look at layer two, right?

04:04.200 --> 04:08.790
Because it's an IP packet, but it will receive it from the physical layer.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.030
Right.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.600
And then transmit it to the data link and we'll look at the destination.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.410
Mac So you want to go to B, I know where B is.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.090
B is right in this port.

04:18.930 --> 04:22.650
Let me send the frames back in this port.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.840
It will not touch this port.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.550
Will not touch this port.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.080
It will not touch this port.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.740
The power of a switch.

04:31.850 --> 04:35.270
If this was a hub, the hub is dump will just.

04:35.450 --> 04:36.740
Hey, okay.

04:36.770 --> 04:40.820
I'm just replicating the electric signal and all of them are bom bom bom bom bom.

04:41.630 --> 04:42.830
Waste of bandwidth.

04:43.130 --> 04:45.610
A waste, complete waste said.

04:46.130 --> 04:48.760
But a switch is smart, so switch knows that.

04:48.770 --> 04:51.890
Oh, it will immediately switch you here.

04:52.190 --> 04:53.510
And there's complicated switch.

04:53.510 --> 04:58.160
We have virtual lands and stuff like that where it can isolate devices.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.930
This is again, this is what I want.

04:59.930 --> 05:05.360
Explain to virtual lines and switches that elegant of the switches and all this stuff.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.590
This is the networking aspects of thing, that deep networking stuff.

05:09.590 --> 05:09.830
Right.

05:10.100 --> 05:15.320
I'm interested in in host also communication a little bit higher level and that's that's pretty much

05:15.320 --> 05:22.190
it so EHS and data to be immediately and only B gets it that's a part of the switch right so that's

05:22.580 --> 05:30.800
that's a simple example here D will send it to X all right D is ten 003x is a completely different network

05:30.800 --> 05:32.390
192168.1.2.

05:33.170 --> 05:41.120
The router belongs to do network then zero zero 100 is a gateway for this network and ten 926811 is

05:41.120 --> 05:47.630
the gateway for this poppy no deal will ask question audio in my subnet find by doing the subnet mask

05:47.690 --> 05:52.910
and we'll find out 99216 definitely not in the subnet because it will upload we'll find out that it's

05:52.910 --> 05:54.710
not ten 00x.

05:54.710 --> 05:54.980
Right.

05:55.460 --> 05:58.370
So it's not so what what does it need to do?

05:59.440 --> 06:01.780
Well, it needs to send to the gateway.

06:01.780 --> 06:02.570
What's its gateway?

06:02.590 --> 06:04.750
The gateway is this ten zero zero hundred.

06:04.780 --> 06:05.110
Right.

06:06.190 --> 06:12.490
And find this out because it ran a DHC protocol before and knows the IP address of the gateway.

06:12.790 --> 06:16.570
But now it needs the MAC address of the gateway, which it doesn't have.

06:16.690 --> 06:17.560
So we'll send.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.240
Hey, hey, guys.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.730
Who has who has ten zero zero hundred?

06:22.420 --> 06:27.070
It will send it to this guy and this guy and this guy and this guy, right?

06:27.580 --> 06:28.090
Why?

06:28.600 --> 06:35.200
Because as a broadcast and the broadcast message frame is literally 000, I believe, and the switch

06:35.200 --> 06:36.560
will say help a broadcast.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.020
So I, I don't have choice.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.070
I need to send it to everybody.

06:39.500 --> 06:39.710
Right.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.890
So that's what the broadcast really means here.

06:42.190 --> 06:46.860
So the router will get sent and will reply back with its ah, that's my mike address.

06:47.350 --> 06:51.600
So we'll send it here and guys with router will send it back only to D.

06:52.150 --> 06:52.480
Right.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.180
Because the one sent to other is not a broadcast.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.680
I doesn't have to tell everybody.

06:56.800 --> 07:02.470
It only tells whoever asked the question because the frame that had the broadcast will have the source

07:02.470 --> 07:06.940
Mac of D and the destination Mac of 000 which is everyone.

07:07.300 --> 07:07.600
Right.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.440
So all will reply back to D and guess what?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.040
The switch will get back them.

07:12.370 --> 07:18.010
Frame says okay, this is the ARP message responds you want to go to D these right here.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.530
Boom doesn't touch the other ports.

07:20.530 --> 07:25.840
So if you have 100 ports, one touch them, switch will switch it directly to that.

07:26.140 --> 07:29.410
This is where high grade switches O'Reilly plays around.

07:29.620 --> 07:36.100
You need a switch that is expensive that can switch as fast as possible and doesn't drop frames.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.370
So now we have the beautiful, beautiful.

07:41.750 --> 07:52.820
Mac address off are now ice and frame that has the IP packet that says hey I want to go to 192168.122.

07:53.330 --> 07:53.720
Right.

07:54.110 --> 07:56.540
But so that's the destination IP address.

07:56.540 --> 08:05.680
But the MAC address is destined to r so the packet goes all the way up the the frame goes to R so so

08:05.870 --> 08:15.320
which says, hey, you want to go to R, I'm going to go to R or can get you to R, but R will check

08:15.740 --> 08:17.780
first if the frame is destined to it.

08:17.780 --> 08:19.160
Yeah, it's just in to me.

08:19.220 --> 08:19.550
Right.

08:19.970 --> 08:23.180
And then it will check the destination IP address.

08:23.180 --> 08:23.960
Where do you want to go.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.660
Oh you want to go to 192168.

08:25.970 --> 08:26.660
One two, two.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.630
Ah I know I'm a network on the other guy.

08:29.870 --> 08:31.040
I am the other side here.

08:31.430 --> 08:36.050
I'll get around you there so we'll keep the source IP address.

08:36.050 --> 08:38.560
Austin 003 send them message.

08:39.170 --> 08:39.740
All right.

08:40.190 --> 08:44.310
And then it will do the exact same scenario.

08:44.330 --> 08:51.200
The doctor will do r a who has 19210212 and it will send it locally to all of us.

08:51.380 --> 08:57.890
It's X, so we'll send the message to X effectively, and then x can apply back exactly the same thing,

08:57.890 --> 08:58.090
right?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.410
X will reply back to their outer.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.650
Right, not the outer.

09:02.650 --> 09:10.190
I will reply back with a from layer two perspective defined destination is that outer from layer three

09:10.190 --> 09:14.150
perspective, the final destination is D which is ten 003.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.470
Same thing here, right?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.780
When do you want to send a message to X layer two?

09:19.810 --> 09:26.500
Final destination is R because that's the network from layer three perspective, the IP address, the

09:26.500 --> 09:28.090
final destination is this guy.

09:29.350 --> 09:31.390
Cool stuff, as good to understand all this stuff.

09:31.420 --> 09:39.790
And finally, the routing example of B to G, which is there this guy wants to talk to G all the way,

09:39.790 --> 09:45.310
eight, eight, eight, eight, which is the DNS resolver or a cursor, I believe, of Google.

09:45.760 --> 09:52.840
So G and obviously doesn't do the Mac address or G because it's all over the other globe, right?

09:53.950 --> 09:57.100
So it does a ten 0041728888.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.750
Definitely not in my subnet.

09:58.900 --> 10:03.580
So I'm going to talk it to the router, talk to the rafters and the frame directly to the router saying

10:03.580 --> 10:05.080
I want to go to eight, eight, eight, eight.

10:05.440 --> 10:11.230
The browser receives the frame of first the switcher who the frame that switch will know you're talking

10:11.230 --> 10:11.380
to.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.600
Also it only sends it to the router.

10:13.840 --> 10:14.100
I don't.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.280
That device thereafter will get the message beautifully done.

10:18.920 --> 10:27.430
The author would say hello ten 004i want to go to 88880, this is not even a local network.

10:27.430 --> 10:28.990
This is the global internet.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.760
I need to use my public IP address.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.980
So the router uses its public IP address.

10:33.250 --> 10:38.290
It actually changes the IP packet itself.

10:38.290 --> 10:40.910
The source IP address no longer becomes ten 004.

10:40.910 --> 10:45.460
What we're going to talk about this and net network address translation, it becomes one, two, three,

10:45.460 --> 10:52.420
four and some Portland land import and it builds in that table and does all that jazz right and since

10:52.420 --> 10:55.180
sends the packet right here to the end through the Internet.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.640
And again, thousands of switches and browsers will play the same role here almost.

11:01.390 --> 11:04.930
It's a little bit more complicated, but it receives the eight, eight, eight, eight.

11:05.410 --> 11:06.340
That's basically it.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.530
So that's a full routing example with three different example I thought about.

11:11.650 --> 11:15.040
So yeah, as a summary, we'll talk about routing examples.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.990
You know, you can route through a hub.

11:17.620 --> 11:23.050
The hub will broadcast that message to all its ports, not effective, not really used anymore.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.220
So which is smart.

11:24.430 --> 11:30.010
It's a layer to a device that look at the Mac address actually passes it, look at the destination Mac

11:30.010 --> 11:33.880
and says, okay, which port that is connected has this Mac address?

11:34.450 --> 11:36.610
Oh, it's this guy I listened to there.

11:37.440 --> 11:37.720
Right.

11:37.750 --> 11:41.170
So it saves a lot of bandwidth.

11:41.170 --> 11:46.810
You know, there is there is no more garbage data well sent and will be dropped.

11:46.810 --> 11:51.910
Right now we're talking about switches, bridges kind of plays the same role as well as just separate

11:52.300 --> 11:57.700
machines on the same network and kind of eliminate the little bit of a bandwidth as well.

11:58.450 --> 12:07.690
But Switch kind of plays the major role router router vector, which plays the role of layer three.

12:08.050 --> 12:10.180
Right, and also plays the role of switch.

12:10.180 --> 12:15.490
If you don't have a switch, you know, if you want to send it to the same as to the same network,

12:15.490 --> 12:16.780
you can use the router to do that.

12:16.780 --> 12:19.120
But a lot of those are layer three protocols.

12:19.330 --> 12:24.190
They allow it packets to different networks effectively, and that includes the Internet effectively.

12:24.610 --> 12:24.880
All right.

12:25.060 --> 12:26.440
So that was the routing example.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.910
Let's jump to the next lecture.
