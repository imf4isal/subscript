WEBVTT

00:00.060 --> 00:00.520
All right.

00:00.540 --> 00:08.790
How about we start this section, the IP protocol with the first lecture, the IP building blocks.

00:09.810 --> 00:17.250
And I named it this way because I think these are the basic, you know, building blocks that we need

00:17.250 --> 00:19.890
to understand in order to understand the IP protocol.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.360
You know, we're going to talk about things that I mentioned in the previous lectures like Subnet Mask

00:24.360 --> 00:28.740
and Network and the whole host and, you know, class lists and stuff like that.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.000
We're going to talk about all that stuff.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.210
You know, I'm just trying to demystify this as much as possible.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.610
What happened when you actually wrote the packet?

00:35.910 --> 00:37.560
What happened when I sending a packet?

00:37.560 --> 00:40.020
No, I'm mentioning the word packet to guide.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.930
And I want you in your brains to think about what a packet is, is the layer three.

00:45.930 --> 00:53.250
Now, when I say packet as layer three, that means it's a bunch of data with destination IP address,

00:53.250 --> 00:56.550
with source IP address that's set with other headers.

00:56.550 --> 00:57.480
But we don't care now.

00:58.140 --> 00:58.320
Right.

00:58.320 --> 00:58.860
But that's it.

00:59.310 --> 00:59.910
Ports.

01:00.630 --> 01:01.650
I don't care for the.

01:01.650 --> 01:07.800
Yeah, that is ports inside of there is the trace and the data, all of this stuff inside this IP back

01:07.860 --> 01:13.590
but to the rafters it's just an IP packet and that's the beauty of this whole all is I think, you know,

01:13.590 --> 01:15.870
if you think about it, let's jump into it.

01:16.140 --> 01:19.440
IP address is a layer three property.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.370
We talked about this.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.780
It can be set automatically or stateless, statically, statically.

01:24.780 --> 01:25.110
Right.

01:25.590 --> 01:27.270
And this is the DHCP thing.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.840
I'm going to talk about it, but the idea is the IP address can be assigned.

01:31.050 --> 01:37.200
You know, this is a way or a network engineering course, actual course detail ID will be valuable.

01:37.200 --> 01:43.110
You know, talking about okay, how is the CPU oracle is assigning this is a network level thing, you

01:43.110 --> 01:47.400
know, networking, network engineering kind of a thing.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.870
You know, it's a little bit more detail.

01:48.870 --> 01:54.570
So I won't gone to that level of detail because hey, I as long as I have an IP address, I'm good.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.860
I'm not troubleshooting my network.

01:56.860 --> 02:03.870
So there are the network engineers who are, you know, well versed and adept in that particular thing,

02:03.870 --> 02:07.590
you know, troubleshooting and oh, IP, the IP.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.510
And how does it work to protocol?

02:09.630 --> 02:10.350
It's all right.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.130
Maybe I will change my mind and add a lecture for it in the future.

02:14.190 --> 02:14.550
Who knows?

02:16.110 --> 02:19.740
But yeah, the IP address can be assigned automatically.

02:19.950 --> 02:24.120
Or you can statically fix it on your machine.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.410
No, and it has.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.290
I will talk about this.

02:26.290 --> 02:29.190
It has a network port and a host portion.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.330
The IP address is a four by two and it's going to be V four and it's more than that.

02:34.740 --> 02:35.430
IPV six.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.350
I'm going to talk about IPV six in this course.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.150
Maybe in the future I'm going to add more.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.100
Yeah, let's keep it law.

02:41.310 --> 02:46.110
But there's so much content as it will add more stuff in the future.

02:46.590 --> 02:48.390
But yeah, there is do a bit right.

02:49.380 --> 02:50.520
And there's two.

02:51.410 --> 02:55.910
Portion the A, B, C, D or the a, b CD.

02:56.390 --> 03:00.800
Is this is the first by a second by third by four by and the slash x.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.470
And I want you to understand this slash x, right?

03:03.740 --> 03:08.210
The X here is the network bits and what remains are the host.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.200
And here's an example.

03:09.230 --> 03:09.500
Yeah.

03:09.740 --> 03:14.660
If you say 12192168.254.0 slash 24.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.680
That is the first 24 bit which is 888.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.670
That's 24.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.740
These puppies are the network portion and this left by alone.

03:27.740 --> 03:31.220
The fourth byte in this case is the host.

03:31.220 --> 03:40.100
That means I can have up to 25d5 horse, right while I can have up to whatever two to the ball 24 networks.

03:40.220 --> 03:45.980
Now the first 24 bit three byte are network host the rest are eight for the host just talked about this

03:46.340 --> 03:49.160
this means we can have up to two the power 24.

03:49.340 --> 03:50.900
Look at how many networks do you on?

03:51.230 --> 03:53.060
Do we really need this much networks?

03:53.240 --> 03:57.650
Ask yourself again if you're a network administrator, that's that's one part of your job.

03:57.650 --> 04:01.250
And this is not something we usually do as a back in and do we build applications.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.560
We need to understand how that packets are delivered.

04:03.920 --> 04:10.070
But configuring the network is something really is better left to the network engineer who this is their

04:10.070 --> 04:11.300
bread and butter, as they say.

04:11.300 --> 04:11.510
Right?

04:11.690 --> 04:12.980
Like how many network do I need?

04:12.980 --> 04:14.900
Oh, do I need slash 24.

04:15.220 --> 04:15.950
A little bit too much.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.540
Let me let me reduce that.

04:17.570 --> 04:21.650
I am more host than networks, actually, and you can play with that.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.990
This is a ward by itself.

04:23.990 --> 04:30.950
That's why I really mentioned that the discourse is not really for a depth network engineer want want,

04:30.960 --> 04:35.810
teach you all these low level stuff, you know, CCNA and passing all these exams.

04:35.810 --> 04:41.780
No, this is actually decided, designed for our software engineers who want to understand the network.

04:41.780 --> 04:42.980
It's a bridge now.

04:43.160 --> 04:47.810
After that, if you're really interested in networking, you might take an actual networking course

04:47.810 --> 04:53.690
and you might have a actually a better, you know, better luck with it if you want if you think about

04:53.690 --> 04:55.730
it, because now you get to understand the high level stuff.

04:58.780 --> 05:03.460
And each of these network will have 2 to 55 hosts.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.650
And this is also called a subnet.

05:05.740 --> 05:11.410
If you ever heard about this subnet because of a subnet subnet mask, very critical concept.

05:11.710 --> 05:16.090
So if I do 19216822 54.0 slash 24.

05:16.420 --> 05:20.850
This is also called a subnet and the subnet must have a subnets mask.

05:20.920 --> 05:27.340
So if the subject mass is used, if you're sending an IP packet, you know, and you have an IP address

05:27.340 --> 05:36.490
and you want to know that is this IP address that I'm about to send to belong to my subnet or not to

05:36.490 --> 05:41.290
answer that particular question because that question will.

05:42.350 --> 05:48.710
Will be forced into to, you know, logics, like if it's in my subnet to do this, if it's not of my

05:48.710 --> 05:49.580
summit, do that.

05:50.060 --> 05:50.360
Right.

05:50.540 --> 05:56.060
If it's in my subnet, you can use the Mac address to send it directly back to the host to host communication.

05:56.330 --> 06:01.220
Just use the mac address to send it directly because it's literally in the same network as you.

06:01.340 --> 06:01.660
Yeah.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.160
While if it's not in your subnet, all bets are off.

06:05.300 --> 06:11.060
You need to talk to someone who knows how to rout this and use it.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.790
This is usually called a router or a gateway.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.010
That's why you have a gateway IP address.

06:16.010 --> 06:19.430
In every network you assign, there's a gateway IP address.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.130
That's when things are unclear.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.560
Hey, what do I know that I don't know.

06:24.680 --> 06:25.700
Send it to the gateway.

06:26.510 --> 06:30.320
Subnet mask is used to determine whether an IP is in the same subnet or not.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.060
Default gateway.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.020
We just talk about this, right?

06:33.470 --> 06:34.310
Default Gateway.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.390
Most networks consist of host and a default gateway.

06:38.510 --> 06:45.260
So you have a network and you have a bunch of hosts right in that network up to whatever the host bets

06:45.260 --> 06:51.590
you are allowed to have that network and there must be one of those host must be a gateway.

06:51.890 --> 06:52.180
Why?

06:52.220 --> 06:56.540
Because those host they want to talk to somewhere outside of their subnet.

06:57.260 --> 06:58.830
They need to talk to the gateway.

06:59.090 --> 07:03.590
The gateway is just another device that happened to have two network interfaces.

07:03.800 --> 07:09.110
One network that is assigned to belong to this network, and another network that belongs to another

07:09.110 --> 07:12.320
network, or maybe three or four or five or six.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.340
These border routers have hundreds of networks.

07:16.340 --> 07:18.170
You know, they can talk to many other networks.

07:18.440 --> 07:23.300
So host a can actually talk to host B directly if they are both in the same network, you know, same

07:23.300 --> 07:24.230
subnet effectively.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.440
And they use the Mac address for that.

07:26.450 --> 07:26.780
Right.

07:27.890 --> 07:34.970
Otherwise, if A doesn't know how to talk to be if it's B is in not in a subnet and it can find out

07:34.970 --> 07:35.990
by using the subnet mask.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.430
We're going to give an example, guys only.

07:37.460 --> 07:38.000
Now, wait a minute.

07:38.450 --> 07:42.080
Otherwise assigns it to someone who might know that gateway.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.240
That Gateway might not know, by the way.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.050
Right.

07:45.470 --> 07:50.690
Because the gateway eventually might talk to another gateway that might know, you know, you get the

07:50.690 --> 07:51.140
point, right?

07:51.350 --> 07:52.550
It's an elegant design.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.020
I absolutely of it.

07:54.770 --> 08:00.440
The Gateway has an IP address on each and each host should know its gateway.

08:00.470 --> 08:00.770
Right.

08:00.980 --> 08:05.600
And it also have multiple IP addresses depending on how many networks are.

08:05.630 --> 08:06.020
Dr. Doctor.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.800
Hey, find an example and I'm going to disappear here so you can see the whole picture.

08:09.830 --> 08:10.250
All right.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.570
So, host 192168.1.3.

08:14.570 --> 08:20.260
Wants to talk to 19216812, two, two, talk.

08:20.270 --> 08:21.590
I use the word talk here.

08:21.590 --> 08:29.600
I really literally mean sending data, sending packets which to translate it to application client front

08:29.600 --> 08:30.980
end back end speak.

08:31.160 --> 08:35.010
We're sending in DTP request, for example, right now that's talking, right?

08:35.240 --> 08:42.140
Assuming 1.1.2 is actually a server and 1 to 3 is actually a client in this case.

08:42.140 --> 08:45.920
Or you want to send a curl request or you do a server.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.600
That's what talks are really mean.

08:47.840 --> 08:56.540
And then to they as I search or not as DTP DNS, all of these fits into a nicely tucked in IP packet

08:56.780 --> 08:59.660
which has a destination IP and the source IP.

08:59.870 --> 09:00.950
And that's the beauty of this.

09:01.110 --> 09:03.080
Browsers don't care about the protocol.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.240
Some routers, unfortunately, do.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.380
They look at the content.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.920
They block certain protocols, but most don't.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.810
No, but let's let's take a look.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.310
192168.12312.21.2.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.260
First of a question, try to answer.

09:18.590 --> 09:20.000
Are you in my subnet?

09:21.170 --> 09:27.440
It applies a subnet mask to itself and the destination IP address would subnet mask it's own subnet

09:27.440 --> 09:27.860
mask.

09:28.190 --> 09:30.560
Right, because that's the only thing it has.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.210
It doesn't have the subject matter of the other machine.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.260
It doesn't need it actually.

09:33.470 --> 09:36.200
It needs the subnet mask of you, which you have.

09:36.410 --> 09:36.650
Right.

09:36.650 --> 09:37.940
You can go to your network.

09:37.940 --> 09:42.950
You're going to have three things the your IP address, your subnet mask and your gateway.

09:43.490 --> 09:46.520
Without these, you are you cannot do anything.

09:46.610 --> 09:48.650
You're basically dead in the water.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.000
You cannot connect with anyone.

09:50.120 --> 09:50.350
Right.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.710
You need these three pieces.

09:52.190 --> 09:57.710
So you take this guy, do that to five, five, two, five, 5255.0.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.360
Apply that right.

09:59.360 --> 10:05.560
If you do the normal and operator, you know this is ones all of these are ones you'll find five via

10:05.570 --> 10:06.050
this one.

10:06.410 --> 10:13.070
Right and this is zero ones and anything one, if you add anything with a one, it becomes the same

10:13.070 --> 10:13.490
value.

10:13.670 --> 10:19.490
So when you add these bits, right, this is simple byte operations.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.820
Anything that you end with a one becomes the same value, right?

10:23.060 --> 10:30.570
So 192 becomes Raymond 992168 with 255 becomes one nine.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.570
Because at the end of these, these are one one.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.050
I wish I, I built a bitmap for you guys, but you get it right.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.640
One, one, one, one, one, one.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.530
And these are actual bits, like one zero, whatever.

10:40.970 --> 10:41.780
So anything you.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.480
And he's going to become the same value.

10:43.690 --> 10:43.890
Right.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.030
Two, five, five, and one becomes one.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.100
And there's the most important thing.

10:48.100 --> 10:48.670
Zero.

10:48.670 --> 10:49.930
And anything is zero.

10:50.740 --> 10:53.220
If you add anything with zero, just nulls it out.

10:53.230 --> 10:53.560
Right.

10:53.890 --> 10:56.110
So zero and three is zero.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.100
All right.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.960
Let's apply to the second IP address two and Z two and zero is zero.

11:02.410 --> 11:03.970
And this is the output from this.

11:04.090 --> 11:10.690
The second IP address, this is out of 19.168.101926.11.120.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.000
These are the same subnet.

11:14.230 --> 11:19.660
And that question leads to the first branch that we talked about which nobody took out.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.820
I don't need to rout it.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.530
I don't need you, guy.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.210
I don't need this guy.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.120
I actually do because it's a switch in this case.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.270
It's playing as a switch.

11:29.290 --> 11:30.430
We're going to talk about it in a minute.

11:30.910 --> 11:36.270
So I am sending this data to my writer, but the writer is just going up to layer two.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.260
In this case, it doesn't need the IP address.

11:38.260 --> 11:38.550
But why?

11:38.560 --> 11:41.560
Because it is in the same subnet, right?

11:42.250 --> 11:46.140
I believe maybe the router will go to that layer and looks at the as.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.650
But it is the same IP address.

11:47.650 --> 11:47.920
Right.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.100
So in this case, it will just say, look at the Mac address.

11:51.370 --> 11:52.120
This is all right.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.520
This Mac address is actually on this board.

11:54.910 --> 11:55.330
Boom.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.470
Let's send it right here.

11:56.740 --> 11:59.320
So the router will act as a switch in this case.

11:59.620 --> 12:03.640
So it will look all it really need just there to this particular case.

12:03.910 --> 12:06.100
And this, by the way, the second one, we're going to come to that.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.060
All right, let's spice things up a little bit.

12:09.330 --> 12:12.630
192.168.1.3.

12:12.630 --> 12:16.170
Wants to talk to 192.168.222.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.490
This guy.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.650
This guy wants to talk to this guy.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.810
Well, it's a different network, right?

12:22.050 --> 12:22.860
How did I know?

12:22.980 --> 12:24.300
Well, apply them, ask.

12:24.510 --> 12:31.290
And all of a sudden, you know that this is 19216120i, I been one, two or three.

12:31.290 --> 12:32.250
Am I right?

12:33.290 --> 12:35.250
Uh, this is my network.

12:35.550 --> 12:39.780
The guy I want to talk to is 2.0 different subnet.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.760
I don't know what to do.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.370
This is different subnet.

12:43.740 --> 12:46.200
I need to routing to someone who does.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.750
The packet is sent to the default gateway.

12:48.990 --> 12:51.810
My default gateways 192168.1.1.

12:53.730 --> 12:56.760
Now you need to send the packet to the router.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.130
I can guess what you need.

12:59.460 --> 13:04.170
This is now loops back to the first scenario.

13:05.170 --> 13:07.510
What are you sending a horse to horse directly.

13:07.990 --> 13:14.230
Now you're as if sending that packet itself destined to this guy.

13:14.680 --> 13:19.240
But the Mac address, right, is the router.

13:19.690 --> 13:23.950
And here's where every attack possible happens.

13:24.550 --> 13:25.900
This is called are poisoning.

13:26.350 --> 13:32.260
If someone here to pretend to be the router, then all the packets can go through it.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.280
And that's how our poisoning happen as another topic for another day, right?

13:37.000 --> 13:42.880
Because the MAC addresses is I need to know what is the Mac address of my router because now I need

13:42.880 --> 13:45.760
to send them back it to my router.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.060
Right.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.390
And my author is in myself the same subnet as I am.

13:50.100 --> 13:50.190
Right?

13:50.250 --> 13:54.850
I sent this to Rather and the router turns around and understand that.

13:54.850 --> 13:56.710
Hey, okay, where is this guy?

13:56.710 --> 13:57.150
One night?

13:57.670 --> 14:01.330
So the router has actually another IP address on the other end.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.620
19.68.22 201.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.820
So router lives, double lives.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.890
You know, it lives two lives.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.590
You know, that's that's what it does, you know.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.780
So it's living two lives effectively.

14:13.780 --> 14:16.600
It's a it's an it's an address here and it's an address here.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.500
So it's living it's a literally you have two representations.

14:20.800 --> 14:27.160
So this can talk to this and this kind of is and that's how this how basically it is done.

14:27.970 --> 14:28.390
All right.

14:28.390 --> 14:33.040
Let's summarize so talked about what an IP address as talked about what is the difference between a

14:33.040 --> 14:34.690
network portion and the host portion.

14:34.960 --> 14:41.920
And you can know what is your network today if you want and you can know how many host can it possibly

14:41.920 --> 14:45.820
happen and you can configure your router to assign more or less.

14:45.820 --> 14:46.570
Host Right.

14:46.720 --> 14:52.210
Based on that and we're talking about the subnet, we are told about the subnet mask, very, very critical

14:52.210 --> 14:53.290
concept to understand.

14:53.680 --> 15:01.120
And we're going to talk about more why this is a critical and in the final section actually where if

15:01.120 --> 15:06.760
your database is actually in a different subnet, then you're back in application.

15:07.120 --> 15:15.220
Then IP packets that are in form of TCP connection request, you know, from your back in application

15:15.220 --> 15:18.670
to that database is going through the router.

15:19.390 --> 15:23.560
And if this routing is congested, then you're going to see delays.

15:24.630 --> 15:29.280
So this is a little bit of a tease and spoiler alert, you know, to that section.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.610
But that's one of the thing that just makes sense.

15:32.970 --> 15:35.370
Do not put your database in a different subnet.

15:35.460 --> 15:40.680
You know, sometimes it's not that that to be honest, it it's okay to put it in a different subnet.

15:40.980 --> 15:48.120
But what happen if this rather is so congested, if it's if it's talking to thousands of the networks,

15:48.330 --> 15:48.560
right.

15:49.140 --> 15:56.280
Or so many networks and so many host it's routing packets, then there might be chances where the router

15:56.280 --> 15:58.050
will buffer will fill down.

15:58.320 --> 16:05.760
And your beautiful sequel statement request, which will transmit to multiple segments, will be posed

16:06.420 --> 16:11.100
in the router and it will never reach the database until a few millisecond later.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.810
And you will see those delays.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.220
You will knows why.

16:14.220 --> 16:16.410
I do have delays in my back in application.

16:17.100 --> 16:23.940
That's just tiny, something tiny and is immediately you understand it because now they understand what

16:23.940 --> 16:24.900
is actually happening.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.940
Now go check your back in configuration.

16:26.940 --> 16:33.360
Do you have your database different than your your application pull in the subnet because it costs you

16:33.360 --> 16:33.720
nothing.

16:34.080 --> 16:34.310
Right.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.060
In this case, put a switch.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.610
Put an actual switch.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.140
This is where network configuration comes into the picture, actually, right?

16:40.320 --> 16:47.370
Where you get to put an actual network switch and you talk a high performing network switch and you

16:47.370 --> 16:54.000
put the database and the application took it to the switch that the application has no business talking

16:54.000 --> 16:55.100
to the router, right?

16:55.200 --> 17:00.420
Don't use the router to run out application packets to your as a switch.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.510
You know that's just a cheap switch at this and right.

17:03.810 --> 17:09.720
Routers is not they are not designed to be switches that's why those high performance switches are cost

17:09.720 --> 17:11.350
a lot of money and they're price switches.

17:11.350 --> 17:18.840
And now again, I'm not very versed in this, but if you really want to go to that level, that's a

17:18.840 --> 17:22.110
network engineering, bread and butter.

17:22.110 --> 17:23.310
You know, that's where.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.570
And that's what I want.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.830
I want to bridge that gap.

17:26.860 --> 17:28.060
That's what I'm talking about, guys.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.710
Back in Engineer.

17:30.580 --> 17:37.240
The moment you understand this, you will ask the network engineer to do this configuration photo because

17:37.290 --> 17:39.960
you don't have no idea what you want.

17:39.970 --> 17:40.170
Right?

17:40.180 --> 17:43.510
Because they know everything, but they don't know what you want.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.200
Right?

17:44.380 --> 17:46.270
So if you are a network engine, you're talking.

17:46.270 --> 17:46.630
Of course.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.050
Thank you.

17:47.260 --> 17:51.640
But you now understand the requirements, right?

17:52.420 --> 17:54.640
But now we're bridging this gap.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.250
We're closing the wound, as they say.

17:57.730 --> 17:58.210
But yeah.

17:58.570 --> 18:03.970
And the default gateway, the concept of the default gateway also has been explained in this lecture.

18:04.360 --> 18:11.320
How about we jump into it and move to the next lecture or the first lecture of the IP packet RFP thing?

18:11.620 --> 18:14.620
You know, there there's so much, so much to discuss here.

18:15.730 --> 18:16.540
Let's jump into it.
