WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:02.490
So we talked about who this course is for.

00:02.760 --> 00:07.560
We talked about an overview of the course, but now what do we need to talk about the outline of the

00:07.560 --> 00:07.920
course?

00:08.190 --> 00:11.190
What are you going to get when you finish by the end of the course?

00:11.460 --> 00:12.540
What are you going to grasp?

00:13.020 --> 00:13.190
All right.

00:13.350 --> 00:14.190
How about we jump into it?

00:14.220 --> 00:21.540
So I broke up this course into six sections, but not necessarily they will remain six section when

00:21.540 --> 00:28.050
you watch this content, because I, as you might know from my other courses, I always add and make

00:28.050 --> 00:30.090
the courses and add more content to the course.

00:30.240 --> 00:35.370
It'll be more than six sections of activity, but the major six sections are.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.610
The first thing I'm going to talk about is the fundamentals of networking.

00:38.610 --> 00:46.540
And these are two sets of lectures that will help you kind of build the foundation, if you will, of

00:46.670 --> 00:51.720
of the networking aspects, like starting from scratch as if you don't know anything.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.440
What why do we need networking?

00:55.440 --> 01:01.830
Why networking was invented as a model client server, architecture, hostels, communication, things

01:01.830 --> 01:02.280
like that.

01:02.580 --> 01:08.820
To talk about just a fundamental on networking that we really need to understand before jumping into

01:08.820 --> 01:16.590
the other protocols, which the first one very critical is the Internet protocol, the IP.

01:16.860 --> 01:23.550
So we're going to demystify everything there is about the Internet protocol, the IP.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.580
And I'm going to go into details here.

01:26.820 --> 01:31.290
I'm going to talk about the routing protocol.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.900
I'm going to talk about how the IP address looks like.

01:34.140 --> 01:37.590
I'm going to talk about how the IP packets are routed.

01:38.130 --> 01:43.890
Go talk about certain protocols that are complementing the IP protocol, ARB, ICMP, stuff like that,

01:43.890 --> 01:51.990
and not just mentioning them, actually linking them with reality with what we do on a daily basis.

01:51.990 --> 01:53.520
And that's what I believe missing.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.730
And most of the courses that I interacted with at least.

01:57.860 --> 02:01.400
The link between what we do and what we study.

02:01.950 --> 02:07.960
Even mathematics, if you know it is like I used to like mathematics, but a lot of people were frustrating

02:07.970 --> 02:13.130
with mathematics because they memorize a formula and I have no idea when to use it because they are

02:13.130 --> 02:14.180
memorizing things.

02:14.420 --> 02:19.280
A lot of people memorize networking concept because they have no idea when this thing shows up.

02:19.580 --> 02:23.680
So I tried to bridge that gap by giving you examples as much as possible.

02:23.690 --> 02:28.760
So I try to give you as much as examples as possible when it comes to linking the networking aspect

02:28.760 --> 02:31.610
with real life examples, you know.

02:32.240 --> 02:38.090
I have 17 years of experience, so I try to pull in examples from personal problems that I've personally

02:38.090 --> 02:45.230
faced and from my colleagues that I ran into or from blogs article I read and I tried to reference all

02:45.230 --> 02:45.560
of these.

02:45.560 --> 02:49.250
So you'll see all the tons of references in this course as well.

02:49.250 --> 02:57.260
And it would be a good idea to download the master slide deck to It's Over, I think 170 slides, you

02:57.260 --> 02:58.820
know, there's a lot of stuff there.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.630
But yeah, it's going to be very, very interesting.

03:02.630 --> 03:06.080
The IP protocol, very, very critical concept.

03:06.110 --> 03:09.890
So another thing in the IP section, I'm going to talk about the IP packet itself.

03:09.890 --> 03:16.130
We're going to turn to the cartoon and then I'll try to understand all these headers that we have.

03:16.130 --> 03:19.430
And then what are the use cases for this head on when they will show up?

03:19.670 --> 03:21.290
And I'm not going to explain all the headers.

03:21.410 --> 03:28.760
I'm going to explain the headers that are personally I interacted with and I they kind of pinched me

03:28.760 --> 03:33.620
in a way or another, you know, some of them obviously I don't know everything, but I will talk only

03:33.620 --> 03:36.560
about the things that I believe is relatable.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.570
You know, some of that not all of the headers are I have personal experience with, so I'll explain

03:41.570 --> 03:42.380
whatever I can.

03:42.440 --> 03:48.830
So as a back an engineer, you really, to be honest, really care about what the headers are and try

03:48.830 --> 03:50.300
to understand or memorize them.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.200
Almost never.

03:51.410 --> 03:54.320
If you want to know what a header looks like, you can just google it.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.030
You know, never memorize anything.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.490
This is not what the course is for, you know?

03:58.730 --> 04:03.170
It's just understanding sometimes what each header do does.

04:03.170 --> 04:07.760
And if you want a refresher, you can always Google how it looks like, you know that's that's what

04:07.760 --> 04:08.930
it really critical here.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.520
And the next one is the UDP.

04:10.520 --> 04:16.460
I started with UDP because kind of TCP is, I would say like a superset of UDP.

04:16.460 --> 04:22.640
UDP is a simpler protocol, you know, so I'll talk about a UDP datagram that's why we call it the pros

04:22.640 --> 04:27.620
and cons of UDP, when to use it, when not use it, you know, as again personal experiences.

04:28.010 --> 04:32.990
And we'll talk about the TCP protocol and talk about the segment concept.

04:32.990 --> 04:37.250
I talk about the handshake, talk about why does TCP exist?

04:37.250 --> 04:46.690
I tried to I had a lecture which explains why do we need blah?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.110
You know, why do we need IP?

04:48.110 --> 04:49.130
Why do I need you to be?

04:49.130 --> 04:54.290
But it kind of it became a little bit a little bit cumbersome to manage.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.880
But that's what that's really what the question you you should ask all the time.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.190
It's like, why do we need IP protocol?

05:02.280 --> 05:08.070
Once you really ask the question of why it really unlocks something in your brain, you know, because

05:08.250 --> 05:11.580
you will understand why it exist.

05:12.090 --> 05:14.580
You know, because always anything exists.

05:14.580 --> 05:20.190
Because most of the time it exists because of a problem that we try to solve and we invent something

05:20.190 --> 05:20.520
to solve.

05:20.520 --> 05:26.220
This problem for nothing exists just for the sake of fashion, you know, always.

05:26.610 --> 05:34.800
And, and I find it personally when I, when I, when I understand why something exists, I, I find

05:34.800 --> 05:36.870
it I find it easier to remember.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.970
I find it, you know, more.

05:39.150 --> 05:44.190
I don't I don't I don't have, you know, fog and misconception anymore.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.330
I just find it very clear.

05:45.330 --> 05:45.600
So.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.320
TCB, We're going to ask you like why this EP exists.

05:49.320 --> 05:54.450
So that's a whole new section is it's filled with content.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.980
You talk about flow control.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.900
Why does full control exist?

05:58.450 --> 05:59.640
We're talk about congestion control.

05:59.670 --> 06:00.400
Why does it exist?

06:00.420 --> 06:06.320
When I was slow, start the super fast open handshake, closing connections connection states.

06:06.320 --> 06:12.060
I'm going to talk about so much stuff, but don't be overwhelmed because most of this is going to be

06:12.060 --> 06:12.360
fun.

06:12.750 --> 06:19.080
Because I'm going to explain because I really enjoy talking about these concepts and relate them to

06:19.080 --> 06:24.570
the to the present, to, to what we do on a daily basis that back intention into two applications that

06:24.570 --> 06:25.200
we develop.

06:25.710 --> 06:28.020
Right instead of just memorizing stuff.

06:28.020 --> 06:33.840
You know, then my favorite section, which is this is the section that kind of bridges the gap.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.480
This is the section, right?

06:36.480 --> 06:38.790
That will.

06:39.860 --> 06:45.470
Cement the first principle of networking and kind of link them to the back end performance, you know,

06:45.710 --> 06:46.400
and this section.

06:46.430 --> 06:50.720
One of my favorite networking concept that effect back in applications design.

06:51.860 --> 06:58.160
You know this this this this section specifically is the link that links that back in engineering to

06:58.160 --> 06:59.270
the network engineering.

06:59.510 --> 07:10.340
You know, you will find most of these lectures that I, I authored as a link to directly to the performance

07:10.340 --> 07:12.560
of the back end application or the front end application.

07:12.560 --> 07:17.870
Because some of this stuff is really a configuration of the client side because the client needs to

07:17.870 --> 07:21.980
make a connection at the end of the day, you know, and the concept of a connection, the concept of

07:21.980 --> 07:31.340
a performance, the concept of why when I make this handshake after a while, immediately I my data

07:31.340 --> 07:37.040
is not getting through like or why is when I started the application is so slow, but after a while

07:37.370 --> 07:41.480
it picks up why I cannot listen on on the same port twice.

07:41.690 --> 07:42.200
Why?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.480
Why cannot why cannot to do that?

07:44.570 --> 07:47.300
Why when I send I tried to send a request.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.780
It's very, very slow and I have no idea why.

07:51.080 --> 07:58.010
There is really something that this large request that I tried to send, it's really slow for some reason

07:58.010 --> 08:00.170
why it doesn't make any sense.

08:00.290 --> 08:01.190
And why does it?

08:01.190 --> 08:05.540
Sometimes when I connect to this server as fast when but when I connect to the server a slow, you know,

08:05.540 --> 08:07.070
the response comes slower.

08:07.670 --> 08:16.760
All these things, you know, while they are a little bit low level understanding them kind of bridges

08:16.760 --> 08:21.980
the gap between the back end application that we write when you actually write a line of code says,

08:21.980 --> 08:29.060
hey, I want to listen to this port on this IP address, what does what is it really that is happening

08:29.210 --> 08:30.500
when I receive data?

08:30.770 --> 08:31.100
No.

08:31.220 --> 08:35.210
And we're going to explain the concept of a request, you know, and all these stuff.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.310
It's fascinating to me.

08:37.310 --> 08:39.140
I absolutely love this thing.

08:39.500 --> 08:46.460
I talk about the maximum segments, ISE and maximum transmission unit and how do this to leg to each

08:46.460 --> 08:54.230
other and why what what determines the size of this packet or the segment specifically?

08:54.230 --> 08:59.900
And is larger packets or segments better you know all these kind of things.

09:00.650 --> 09:09.590
I how fast can I send data all the you know and how does this translate to manage GDP request get request

09:09.590 --> 09:14.450
for example all these things my thought to explain this as much as possible then as I believe it's going

09:14.450 --> 09:20.390
to be fun and unfortunately is not it won't be a networking course without actually firing up Wireshark,

09:20.420 --> 09:26.570
which is if you don't know Wireshark is this utility that allows you to sniff any packet that is going

09:26.570 --> 09:29.360
out of your machine that Wireshark is in a stolen.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.160
And we'll look through that.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.920
So we're going to warthog TCP protocol.

09:33.920 --> 09:40.810
We're going to want to CHAKA UDP how looks like we're going to wireshark ebs we go through it.

09:40.820 --> 09:44.900
We will do a trick to actually describe the Dallas handshake and look at the content.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.150
So there's going to be so much fun.

09:47.840 --> 09:54.560
Obviously, if there was an additional section, I'll add a new kind of a lecture, talk about the course

09:54.560 --> 09:58.430
update and then just like I do with my database and other courses as well.

09:59.090 --> 10:02.060
So I believe I really hope you enjoy and enjoy this course.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.770
And let's get started.
