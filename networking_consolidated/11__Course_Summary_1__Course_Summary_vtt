I'm going to inject content in the middle right as the months ago because I like to listen to you guys,

00:22.380 --> 00:27.930
hear your feedback, get ideas of things I need to add and then improve the content.

I've been doing this since all my courses really, and I and I absolutely love it.

00:33.180 --> 00:40.320
So this network engineering is a fascinating topic and it's definitely one of the major pillars when

00:40.320 --> 00:41.370
it comes to backend engineers.
